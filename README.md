### Generative AI using Langchain by CampusX

This repository contains my learning journey and practice code for the **Langchain Tutorial Series** by CampusX. I'm following along with the [Langchain Tutorial Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSVk-5WemQ0&list=PLKnIA16_RmvaTbihpo4MtzVm4XOQa0ER0) and implementing all the concepts and examples.

## 📚 About This Repository

This is a hands-on learning repository where I practice and implement various Langchain concepts, from basic LLM interactions to advanced features like embeddings, document processing, memory, agents, RAG and more. Each folder contains practical examples and working code that demonstrates different aspects of Langchain.
